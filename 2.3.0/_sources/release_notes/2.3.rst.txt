Mantid Imaging 2.3
==================

This release brings some significant new features:

Bad data indicators
   Show pixel values that can cause issues during reconstruction, NaNs (not a number) caused by missing data or invalid math operations and non-positive values caused by noise or issues with dark frame subtraction.

Beam hardening correction
  Mantid Imaging now implements a linearization correction to compensate for the beam hardening effect.

Dataset side-bar
   The main window now shows a tree-view of loaded datasets and their stacks. Internally Mantid Imaging now has a more structured view of the loaded data, which will allow further user interface improvements.

User interface improvements
   The parameter controls in operations and reconstruction windows now have finer step sizes and better defaults. Auto preview in the reconstruction window can be disabled.

There have also been many smaller changes and fixes which are listed below.
