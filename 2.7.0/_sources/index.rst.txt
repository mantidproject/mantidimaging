MantidImaging
=============

Mantid Imaging is a graphical toolkit for performing 3D reconstruction of neutron tomography data. It provides an easy-to-use graphical interface to a wide range of pre/post-processing operations, tilt correction and reconstruction algorithms, accommodating for tomography users with varying data complexity and image analysis background knowledge. It utilises a flexible plugin system that allows easy integration of external software, and has allowed us to re-use software widely known in the neutron tomography community.
