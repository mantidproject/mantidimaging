Mantid Imaging 2.4
==================

This release brings some significant new features:

Windows support
   This release contains initial Windows support. It should be fully functional, although may have performance differences compared to Linux. It can be installed using conda (See :ref:`Installation`). We are interested in user feedback and aim to ship an installer in a future version.

NEXUS export
   MI can now save datasets into the NXtomo and NXtomoproc formats.

Operations window improvements
  * Angle/Z slider
       In the operations window there is now a slider to move through images in a stack.
  * Automatic sinograms
       It is no longer necessary to manually convert to sinograms to use the stripe removal filters
  * Improvements to levels and zoom
       These are now locked by default to so it is easier to see the effect of changes to filters. They can be unlocked to enable auto scaling.

Reconstruction improvements
  * CIL PDHG non-negativity constraint
  * Line profile
       Movable line profile through the reconstruction preview

Internal changes
   In order to support Windows MI has switched its multiprocessing implementation from fork to spawn which has required a change from multiprocessing.SharedArray to multiprocessing.shared_memory.

Experimental spectrum viewer
   Some initial work on supporting Time of Flight imaging data.

Many fixes and clean ups to the code

Removed some unneeded options
  * ROI normalisation - preserve max option
  * Stripe Removal filter (note other 5 stripe removal filters remain)
  * Console progress bar

There have also been many smaller changes and fixes which are listed below.
