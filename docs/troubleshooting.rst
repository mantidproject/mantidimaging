Logging
-------

Logging can be configured interactively via the **Settings > Logging** tab. From here, you can customise how log data is collected, stored, and used for debugging or performance analysis.

The following options are available:

- **Log Directory**: The directory where log files are saved. If left empty, no log file is written.
- **Retention (days)**: Defines how many days logs are kept before automatic deletion.
- **Performance Logging**: Enables detailed performance profiling and timing logs for key operations.
- **Log Level**: Controls the level of detail outputted to the log.

The log level determines how much information is recorded. Mantid Imaging supports the following standard log levels:

+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| Level     | Description                                                  |
+===========+==============================================================+
| DEBUG     | Detailed developer-focused messages                          |
+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| INFO      | General workflow steps and user actions                      |
+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| WARNING   | Recoverable problems or fallback behaviors                   |
+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| ERROR     | Failed operations that interrupt the workflow                |
+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| CRITICAL  | Severe issues such as crashes or data corruption             |
+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------+

.. note::

   Log file retention only applies to the currently configured log directory.
   If you change the directory after logs have been written, previous log files
   in older directories will **not** be automatically deleted. You may need to
   manage these manually.

Logging settings can also be configured manually via the `QSettings` configuration file.

**Locations by platform:**

- **Linux**: :file:`~/.config/mantidproject/Mantid Imaging.conf`
- **Windows**: Stored in the Windows Registry under:
  :file:`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\mantidproject\\Mantid Imaging`
- **IDAaaS**: Same as Linux, usually in the userâ€™s home directory at:
  :file:`~/.config/mantidproject/Mantid Imaging.conf`

For example::

    [logging]
    log_level=DEBUG
    log_dir=/tmp/mantid_imaging_logs
    performance_log=true

Can't reconstruct with FBP_CUDA and SIRT_CUDA
---------------------------------------------

These algorithms have 2 requirements:

- Having a CUDA-compatible graphics card (GPU)
- Having the `CUDA Runtime 12.9 <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64&target_version=11&target_type=exe_network>`_ libraries installed


Having a CUDA-compatible graphics card
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please check that your GPU is on the list of compatible GPUs: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus

Having the CUDA Runtime 12.9 libraries installed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please install the CUDA Runtime version 12.9 binaries from https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64&target_version=11&target_type=exe_network

Reinstalling `CUDA 12.9 <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64&target_version=11&target_type=exe_network>`_ on Linux can be quickly done with this script:


.. code-block:: bash

    # uninstall nvidia driver and cuda driver
    nvidia-uninstall && /usr/local/cuda/bin/cuda-uninstaller

    # download the CUDA installer
    wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/12.9.0/local_installers/cuda_12.9.0_550.54.14_linux.run -O ~/Downloads/cuda_12.9.0_550.54.14_linux.run

    # install GPU driver and CUDA Toolkit from CLI silently
    sudo bash ~/Downloads/cuda_12.9.0_550.54.14_linux.run  --silent --driver --toolkit


Specific Errors
===============


SystemError: <built-in function connectSlotsByName> returned a result with an error set
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This means that the PyQt package is missing or an old version (it must be newer than PyQt5==5.13.2).

Suggested Fix
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install PyQt5 and pyqtgraph with :code:`pip install pyqt5==5.15 pyqtgraph==0.12`.



qt.qpa.plugin: Could not load the Qt platform plugin "xcb" in "" even though it was found
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This might mean that some system libraries are missing.

Suggested Fix
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Try installing :code:`apt install libxcb-xinerama0`.



qt.qpa.xcb: could not connect to display...
-------------------------------------------

Missing :code:`DISPLAY` variable. This means the application cannot find the display to show itself on.

Suggested Fix
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can set this via :code:`export DISPLAY=:N` where :code:`:N` should be the number of your display.



IDAaaS Terminal Error Messages
------------------------------
Errors from the terminal when Mantid Imaging is launched, such as:

:code:`ERROR: ld.so: object 'libdlfaker.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded: ignored.`

These are harmless and can be ignored.

UserWarning: CUDA path could not be detected. Set CUDA_PATH environment variable if CuPy failed to load
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This warning likely indicates that the  :code:`CUDA_PATH` environment variable is not set correctly, or that the `CUDA Toolkit 12.9 <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64&target_version=11&target_type=exe_network>`_  is not installed on your system.

If Mantid Imaging is running correctly, you can ignore this warning. However, if you are experiencing issues with CUDA-based algorithms such as PDHG, you may need to set the  :code:`CUDA_PATH` environment variable to the path where `CUDA Toolkit 12.9 <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64&target_version=11&target_type=exe_network>`_  is installed on your machine. Instructions for setting environment variables can be found below under the  :ref:`ImportError: DLL load failed while importing astra_c <importerror-dll-load-failed-while-importing-astra_c-the-specified-module-could-not-be-found>` section.

.. _importerror-dll-load-failed-while-importing-astra_c-the-specified-module-could-not-be-found:

ImportError: DLL load failed while importing astra_c: The specified module could not be found
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This error usually means that :code:`astra-toolbox` is not installed correctly or the CUDA Runtime libraries are missing.

By default, the CUDA-version of :code:`astra-toolbox` is installed during environment setup, **HOWEVER** it is possible for the incorrect version to be installed for non-NVIDIA GPUs or for machines without a GPU. You can check which version is installed by running the command :code:`mamba list astra-toolbox` in a terminal and verifying that the version installed is the python or cuda version of the package. If the CUDA-version is installed, but you do not have a compatible GPU or the CUDA Runtime libraries installed, you will likely encounter this error.

If you are still experiencing this error after verifying that you have a compatible GPU and the CUDA Runtime libraries installed, it is possible that `CUDA Toolkit 12.9 <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64&target_version=11&target_type=exe_network>`_ is not installed correctly or the environment variable  :code:`CUDA_PATH` is not set correctly.

You can check if Windows can find your CUDA device drivers are present by opening a terminal and entering the command:  :code:`nvidia-smi` you should see an  output similar to the following:

Example output from nvidia-smi:

**Common causes include:**

- When the CUDA-version of :code:`astra-toolbox` is installed on a machine that does not have a GPU.
- When the Python-version of :code:`astra-toolbox` is installed on a machine that has a GPU but does not have the correct CUDA Runtime libraries installed.
- Possibly after upgrading from Windows 10 to Windows 11, where the CUDA device drivers are not compatible with the new OS or have been misplaced or removed.

**Troubleshooting Steps**

1. **Check for a CUDA-Compatible GPU**

   - Visit the `NVIDIA CUDA GPUs page <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus>`_ to confirm your GPU is compatible.
   - If you do not have a compatible GPU, install the Python-version of :code:`astra-toolbox` instead of the CUDA-version.

2. **Verify astra-toolbox Version**

   - Run :code:`mamba list astra-toolbox` in a terminal.
   - Ensure you have the correct version:  

- **Python-version:**

  - Pattern: :code:`astra-toolbox=2.1*=py*`
  - Example: :code:`astra-toolbox=2.1*=py310h7b2d6b3_0`

- **CUDA-version:**

  - Pattern: :code:`astra-toolbox=2.1*=py*_cuda*`
  - Example: :code:`astra-toolbox=2.1.*=py310h7b2d6b3_0_cuda105`

.. note::
   - If you have a CUDA-compatible GPU but the Python-version of :code:`astra-toolbox` is installed, you can install the CUDA-version by running the command: :code:`mamba install astra-toolbox=2.1.*=py310h7b2d6b3_0_cuda105` in a terminal.
   - If you are still experiencing this issue in the instance where you have a CUDA-compatible GPU and the CUDA-version of :code:`astra-toolbox` is installed, it's likely that the issue is related to your CUDA Runtime libraries.

3. **Check CUDA Toolkit Installation and Environment Variable**

   - Run :code:`nvcc --version` in a terminal to check if the `CUDA Toolkit 12.9 <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64&target_version=11&target_type=exe_network>`_  is installed and accessible i.e. your :code:`CUDA_PATH` environment variable has been set correctly.
   - If this fails, reinstall the `CUDA Toolkit 12.9 <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64&target_version=11&target_type=exe_network>`_.
   - Set the environment variable ``CUDA_PATH`` to your CUDA installation path (e.g., ``C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.9\bin``):

     1. Use Windows Search to find  and open **"Edit environment variables for your account"** .
     2. Click **"New"** under user variables.
     3. Set the variable name to ``CUDA_PATH`` and the value to your CUDA installation path.
     4. Restart your machine.
     5. Open a new terminal and run :code:`echo %CUDA_PATH%` to confirm.

4. **Rebuild Your Developer Environment**

   - After confirming CUDA is installed and ``CUDA_PATH`` is set, run ``python3 ./setup.py create_dev_env`` to ensure the correct :code:`astra-toolbox` version and CUDA libraries are available.
