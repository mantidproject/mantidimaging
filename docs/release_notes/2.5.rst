Mantid Imaging 2.5
==================

This release brings some significant new features:

Stochastic PDHG Reconstruction
   New reconstruction option from CIL. This gives faster convergence and lower memory usage by splitting the input data into subsets.

Golden Ratio datasets
   Datasets recorded using the golden ration method can now be opened correctly, using angle information in the log file.

Performance improvements
   - Startup time
   - Arithmetic filter
   - CIL reconstruction
   - TIFF loading

Spectrum Viewer
   Complete the base feature set of the Spectrum viewer.

   - Multiple ROIs and spectrum plots
   - Output ROI coordinates

User interface improvements
   - Better stack selection in main window
   - Modifying image stack in a dataset
   - Operations ROI defaults to a sensible size

Improved Nexus Support
   - Loading reconstructions
   - Better nexus spec conformance
   - Saving data as float32 (for NXtomoproc this is not yet in the official spec)

Windows Installer
   See :ref:`Installing with Windows installer`

There have also been many smaller changes and fixes which are listed below.
