Installation
============

Requirements
------------

Operating system
   Linux. Tested on Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04 and CentOS 7

Python 3.8
   This can be installed below using Conda if needed.

GPU
   A CUDA capable GPU is required for some operations. CPU alternatives are provided, so it is possible to perform a tomographic reconstruction on a system without a GPU.

RAM
   A large amount of RAM is needed to hold a dataset in memory. A 2k x 2k resolution with 1k projections held as 32 bit floats uses 16 GB of RAM. To perform safe (undoable) operations the requirement is doubled. Requirements scale with increased resolution, projection counts and bit depth.

Installing
----------

The simplest way to install the toolkit is via the packages_ published to Anaconda Cloud, this
can be done with an existing Anaconda or Miniconda distribution if you already
have one on your machine.

.. _packages: https://anaconda.org/mantid/mantidimaging/


1. These dependencies must be present on your system before installing the Mantid Imaging environment.
Please look for instructions specific to your OS on how to do that:

  - CUDA Runtime version 10.2 - https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.2-download-archive
  - gcc - needed for compiling some python modules

2. Download and install `Miniconda 3 <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_
3. Make sure :code:`conda` is available on your PATH
4. Create a mantidimaging conda environment:

  - :code:`conda env create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mantidproject/mantidimaging/release-2.2.0/environment.yml`


5. This creates an environment called :code:`mantidimaging` that you can activate via :code:`conda activate mantidimaging`
6. [Optional] If you wish to run `mantidimaging-ipython`, you will need to have `ipython` installed. This can be done
   with the command `conda install ipython`.

Running the package
-------------------

1. Activate the environment created in the installation step: :code:`conda activate mantidimaging`
2. Run using one of the following commands:

  - GUI: :code:`mantidimaging`
  - IPython: :code:`mantidimaging-ipython`

Running the source
------------------

To run from a downloaded source code, e.g. a git checkout:

1. Activate the environment created in the installation step: :code:`conda activate mantidimaging`
2. Run using one of the following commands:

  - From the root of the repository run with :code:`python -m mantidimaging`

Nightly version
---------------

The latest nightly version can be installed with

  - :code:`conda env create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mantidproject/mantidimaging/master/environment.yml`

This will make a `mantidimaging-nightly` environment.


Updating
--------
To update to the latest version of Mantid Imaging run:

:code:`conda activate mantidimaging && conda update mantidimaging`

If you see any issues with package compatibility, the fastest solution is reinstalling the environment - see below.

Reinstalling the environment
----------------------------
To completely delete the Mantid Imaging environment follow these steps:

- :code:`conda deactivate`

  - to exit out of the conda Mantid Imaging environment

- :code:`conda env list`

  - to see which environments you have installed

- :code:`conda env remove -n mantidimaging`

  - and press :code:`y` to confirm. Replace `mantidimaging` with any other environment you wish to remove

- Follow steps 3 and 4 from Installing_.
